# UserPCA notebook descriptions


## analyze_userpca


Processing PCA clique data
Run t-sne on some (all) of the PCA data? Would be useful for grouping them together. UMAP us a cool alternative
but might require too much effort to understand the underlying algorithm.

The graphs plotted are graphs from a PCA, where connections weaker 
than the fourth-strongest connection are set to 0.
The graphs can be saved using the `filename`-keyword.
